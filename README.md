## About SMASHNOTES

A note-taking application for competitive players of the game Super Smash Bros Melee, SMASHNOTES allows users to record and title notes on each of the game's 26 characters. Users can also delete notes when done with them. Each character page also displays stats and information from [Smashlounge's API](http://smashlounge.com/api/doc) that players may find useful. Next on the list of features to add is a backend that will allow notes to persist across sessions.
